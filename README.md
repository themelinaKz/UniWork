# Uniwork
Here is some of my work as an **undergraduate** Computer Science student at [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://aueb.gr/). 

### - Applied Machine Learning - Data Analysis *(winter semester, 2020)*
Three **iPython Jupyter** projects developed in the course of Applied Machine Learning. The projects include **data analysis** on elections, studies and Parliament's proceedings, and machine learning regarding **classification** using different algorithms with **cross-validation** and a **neural network**.

### - MIPS-Sparse Array Converter *(winter semester, 2018)*
A program in **MIPS assembly**, which converts sparse arrays to a more memory-friendly form, and some other features.

### - PostgreSQL Databases *(spring semester, 2019)*
A database with rental listings data from AirBnB and Zillow on the **Amazon AWS cloud** platform and connected to it via a **PostgreSQL** desktop client (pgAdmin) , to be able to execute SQL queries. Multiple tasks like writing queries, creating indexes and connection to DB using Python are also included.

### - SQL Server Databases *(spring semester, 2020)*
This project consists of **two main parts**, and was conducted using **DBMS Microsoft SQL Server**. The general purpose of the **1<sup>st</sup> part** is to learn the basics of DBMS Microsoft SQL Server and to examine the practical use of indexes inside a database. The general purpose of the **2<sup>nd</sup> part** is to build a **Star Schema Data Warehouse**, which will ease the statistical analysis of the data per various factors.  

### - Web Development Exercises *(spring semester, 2021)*
Two different websites in HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript. The **1<sup>st</sup>** one is a basic portofolio written in HTML and CSS, and it is my first Web Development assignment. The **2<sup>nd</sup>** one is about 5G Technology written in HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, with the main goal to be to build a responsive website using **media queries** and different layouts. A form validated with **Constraint Validation API** is also included.
