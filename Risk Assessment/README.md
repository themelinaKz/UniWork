# Risk Assessment
This risk assessment was conducted during the course of Information Systems Security and using **FMEA** method.

After analyzing all the industry's assets and their functions,potential threats were detected as well as their potential vulnerabilities. Following the detection of the possible impacts of the above on the industry, as well as already existing detective and preventive controls, measures such as **impact**, **likehood** and **vulnerability** were estimated based on all the above. Following the FMEA method, assets were ranked by **RPN** (*Risk Priority Number*), to find all assets requiring control improvements.  
Finally, more controls are suggested to minimize the vulnerabilities of the industry.
